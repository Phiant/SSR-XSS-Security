### Minor Analysis Improvements

* AST and types related to parameter packs are now extracted

* Fixed a bug where some flow sinks at field accesses were not being correctly identified.
* Added indexed `getVariable` to `CaptureListExpr`, improving its AST printing and data flow.
* Added flow models for `String` methods involving closures such as `String.withUTF8(_:)`.
