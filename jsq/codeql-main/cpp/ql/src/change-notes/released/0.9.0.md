## 0.9.0

### Breaking Changes

* The `cpp/tainted-format-string-through-global` query has been deleted. This does not lead to a loss of relevant alerts, as the query duplicated a subset of the alerts from `cpp/tainted-format-string`.

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `cpp/use-of-string-after-lifetime-ends`, to detect calls to `c_str` on strings that will be destroyed immediately.
