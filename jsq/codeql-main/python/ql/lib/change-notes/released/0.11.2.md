## 0.11.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added support for functions decorated with `contextlib.contextmanager`.
* Namespace packages in the form of regular packages with missing `__init__.py`-files are now allowed. This enables the analysis to resolve modules and functions inside such packages.
