## 0.11.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

- Added support for tarfile extraction filters as defined in [PEP-706](https://peps.python.org/pep-0706). In particular, calls to `TarFile.extract`, and `TarFile.extractall` are no longer considered to be sinks for the `py/tarslip` query if a sufficiently safe filter is provided.
* Added modeling of `*args` and `**kwargs` as routed-parameters in request handlers for django/flask/FastAPI/tornado.
- Added support for type parameters in function and class definitions, as well as the new Python 3.12 type alias statement.
* Added taint-flow modeling for regular expressions with `re` module from the standard library.
