# When changing/updating these, the `Cargo.Bazel.lock` file has to be regenerated.
# Check out the documentation at https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/crate_universe.html#repinning--updating-dependencies
# for how to do so. The bazel repository for the tsg-python project is called `py_deps`,
# and instead of calling `bazel sync`, `./build --bazel sync` should be used instead, to always use the correct bazel version.
