## 0.3.3

### New Queries

* Added new query "System command built from user-controlled sources" (`swift/command-line-injection`) for Swift. This query detects system commands built from user-controlled sources without sufficient validation. The query was previously [contributed to the 'experimental' directory by @maikypedia](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/13726) but will now run by default for all code scanning users.
* Added a new query "Missing regular expression anchor" (`swift/missing-regexp-anchor`) for Swift. This query detects regular expressions without anchors that can be vulnerable to bypassing.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added additional sinks for the "Uncontrolled data used in path expression" (`swift/path-injection`) query. Some of these sinks are heuristic (imprecise) in nature.
* Fixed an issue where some Realm database sinks were not being recognized for the `swift/cleartext-storage-database` query.
