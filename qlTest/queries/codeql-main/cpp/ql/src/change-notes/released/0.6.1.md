## 0.6.1

### New Queries

* A new query `cpp/double-free` has been added. The query finds possible cases of deallocating the same pointer twice. The precision of the query has been set to "medium".
* The query `cpp/use-after-free` has been modernized and assigned the precision "medium". The query finds cases of where a pointer is dereferenced after its memory has been deallocated.
