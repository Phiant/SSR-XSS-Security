## 0.7.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added [Request.Cookie](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.Cookie) to reflected XSS sanitizers.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where data flow nodes in files that are not in the project being analyzed (such as libraries) and are not contained within a function were not given an enclosing `Callable`. Note that for nodes that are not contained within a function, the enclosing callable is considered to be the file itself. This may cause some minor changes to results.
