* The query "Slice memory allocation with excessive size value" (`go/uncontrolled-allocation-size`) has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. Its results will now appear by default. This query was originally [submitted as an experimental query by @Malayke](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/15130).
