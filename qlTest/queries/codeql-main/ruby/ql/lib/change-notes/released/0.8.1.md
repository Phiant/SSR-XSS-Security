## 0.8.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Deleted the deprecated `isWeak` predicate from the `CryptographicOperation` class.
* Deleted the deprecated `getStringOrSymbol` and `isStringOrSymbol` predicates from the `ConstantValue` class.
* Deleted the deprecated `getAPI` from the `IOOrFileMethodCall` class.
* Deleted the deprecated `codeql.ruby.security.performance` folder, use `codeql.ruby.security.regexp` instead.
* GraphQL enums are no longer considered remote flow sources.
