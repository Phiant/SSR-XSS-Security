## 0.8.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* java/summary/lines-of-code now gives the total number of lines of Java and Kotlin code, and is the only query tagged `lines-of-code`. java/summary/lines-of-code-java and java/summary/lines-of-code-kotlin give the per-language counts.
* The query `java/spring-disabled-csrf-protection` has been improved to detect more ways of disabling CSRF in Spring.
