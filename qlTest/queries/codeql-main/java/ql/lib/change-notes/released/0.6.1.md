## 0.6.1

### Deprecated APIs

* The `sensitiveResultReceiver` predicate in `SensitiveResultReceiverQuery.qll` has been deprecated and replaced with `isSensitiveResultReceiver` in order to use the new dataflow API.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Changed some models of Spring's `FileCopyUtils.copy` to be path injection sinks instead of summaries.
* Added models for the following packages:
  * java.nio.file
* Added models for [Apache HttpComponents](https://hc.apache.org/) versions 4 and 5.
* Added sanitizers that recognize line breaks to the query `java/log-injection`.
* Added new flow steps for `java.util.StringJoiner`.
