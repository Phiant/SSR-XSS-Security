## 0.8.3

### Deprecated APIs

* In `SensitiveApi.qll`, `javaApiCallablePasswordParam`, `javaApiCallableUsernameParam`, `javaApiCallableCryptoKeyParam`, and `otherApiCallableCredentialParam` predicates have been deprecated. They have been replaced with a new class `CredentialsSinkNode` and its child classes `PasswordSink`, `UsernameSink`, and `CryptoKeySink`. The predicates have been changed to using the new classes, so there may be minor changes in results relying on these predicates.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The types `java.util.SequencedCollection`, `SequencedSet` and `SequencedMap`, as well as the related `Collections.unmodifiableSequenced*` methods are now modelled. This means alerts may be raised relating to data flow through these types and methods.
