## 0.8.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Java classes `MethodAccess`, `LValue` and `RValue` were renamed to `MethodCall`, `VarWrite` and `VarRead` respectively, along with related predicates and class names. The old names remain usable for the time being but are deprecated and should be replaced.
* New class `NewClassExpr` was added to represent specifically an explicit `new ClassName(...)` invocation, in contrast to `ClassInstanceExpr` which also includes expressions that implicitly instantiate classes, such as defining a lambda or taking a method reference.
* Added up to date models related to Spring Framework 6's `org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity`.
* Added models for the following packages:

  * com.alibaba.fastjson2
  * javax.management
  * org.apache.http.client.utils
